https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiKMIuYidY0&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A&t=7437


machine learning is about a course,that is,select dataset,select model,train the model and use model valuation function to judge the model and affairm the model,the last step is preidct using the selected model!



f!d@i#o$e%b^

1.Value network
Then, a value network was trained on 30 million game positions obtained while the policy network played against itself. As a reminder, the value network is supposed to predict the likelihood of a win, give the current game-state. It is therefore similar to an evaluation function, with the difference that the value network is learned instead of designed

2.network 
 network was used to guide the next step,the first priod the net was trained by 
 the human  expert knowledge,but later,it use the machine-self -play outcome to train. 



3.Putting all pieces together: Tree search
AlphaGo's tree search procedure is somewhat similar to MCTS, but is guided by all three types of networks in an innovative manner. I will not go into too much detail here, as the full approach is somewhat involved.

Similarly to Deep Blue, AlphaGo uses an evaluation function to give a value estimate of a given state. AlphaGo uses a mixture of the output of the value network and the result of a self-play simulation of the fast policy network:

value of a state = value network output + simulation result.

This is interesting because it suggests a mixture of intuition and reflection. The value network provides the intuition, whereas the simulation result provides the reflection. The AlphaGo team also tried to use only the value network output, or only the simulation result, but those provided worse results than the combination of the two. It is also interesting that the value network output and the simulation result seem to be equally important.

The slow policy network is also used to guide the tree search. Here, the exploration/exploitation trade-off we previously mentioned is kept in mind. Given a game state, the policy network outputs a probability value for each legal move. This output is then divided by the number of times this move was taken in this state in the simulation. This encourages exploration by penalizing actions that were chosen often.

  should use from .  import bar(if must).when you should
  use form bar import bar
about pep8 ,imho,you ned tool to format and read more  about
matrerail

PYTHON's unicode decode and encode is a pile of shit.
about a=b a and b all refer to same object
about c=a[2:3],c is a new list.from now, i think only a=b,a is b
all other situations,not same object,may values is same
item 5 is  ok ,i master.

,but origin function need to have have return value ,the return
value will be used to make somthings.for example ,i write a decorater
function to print decorated function got arguments.i think that
youtube and twitter or internet have good resource to help
you become more great pythoner .python also have a view,that is,
your code is pythonic..........from where i stand,i find that if you
can not make use of anonoly to compare .after this time,you will forgrt

algorithm
--------
i understand algorithm is about :sort ,search,heap,queqe,stack,link list,graph,my view is form
yanweimin,i can remember sort is very importtant ,sort algorithm has so many types:bubble sort,
bucket sort,heap sort ,iterate sort,or so on, i canot remember ,bubble sort 's principle is very simple,in ervery iteration,you need  to make the corresponding element to correct position.if there is 1,3,4,2,5'
for 5>2,you left position ,for 2<4,2 will be in 4  origin postion ,for 2<3,2 will  be in 3's position ,for
2>1, i will go 1,i 's left position has no number .first sort is ok!!!!!iin algorithm ,i dislike complixity
analysis.for i feel that i cannot grasp math and logic in these algorithm.i believe 5,4,3,2,1 is the
shit  case of bubble sort.this is o(n*n)! i remember there is another and usual sort algorithm............

in the most recent,i want to know.when i run  a python  program
a=1
b=2
def test(a,b):
    reutrn (a+b)
from csapp view , ithin k memory donot have acllocte for name inly allocate space for value
when meet a function test,which  will vuild a stack ,i understand that is another space
in memory,thet will use csapp theory.FROM  PHD ZHANG,I GET A VIEW ,a=1,a is  not cllocated space and
whe python call a test function ,that is ,then,it will allocate a space.

i think my python consists :before outputing result,what deos python interpreter do??string and byte,unicode,python all method.what in-memory
actions is??

-----
python
--------
python interpreter is composed of compiler and vm.compiler produce
bytecode ,vm excute bytecode to produce result.

-------
python
-------
there are intepreter and compiler ,the interpreter will proccess source code
and run the result of processing,donot need to transform source code
to machine code ,the aboving machine code is compiler work by compiler.
-------
python

i think i need to know python interpreter how to work ,becuase , i donot be get
used to gap the stage of how python file to be excute?
